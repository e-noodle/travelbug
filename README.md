#####  Accruing Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs)

The number of EQMs you earn is based on a combination of miles flown and the fare/booking code purchased

For example, on American Airlines marketed flights:

*   Full First and Business Fare tickets earn 3 EQMs per mile flown
*   Discounted First and Business Fare tickets earn 2 EQMs per mile flown
*   Full Economy Fare tickets earn 1.5 EQMs per mile flown
*   Discounted Economy Fare tickets 1 EQM per mile flown

Tickets purchased for travel on flights marketed by other carriers may earn a different (sometimes lower) amount for the same fare or booking code.  Please see the other eligible airline's page on [aa.com](http://aa.com/) to view their EQM accrual rate (see links above).

To determine which fare you will be purchasing, simply ask your booking agent (if in person or on the phone). When booking on [aa.com](http://aa.com/), check the ‘Flight Summary’ screen or click the (+) sign to the right of the flight number.

**Tips for success**

*   Plan your qualifying flights to meet your goal within the 3-month time frame selected
*   Fly on an eligible carrier, including eligible codeshare flights marketed by an eligible carrier
*   Upgrading? Keep in mind that EQMs earned are based on the class-of-service purchased
