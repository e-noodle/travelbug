**Accruing Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs)**

The number of EQMs you earn is based on a combination of miles flown and the fare/booking code purchased

For example, on American Airlines marketed flights:

*   Full First and Business Fare tickets earn 3 EQMs per mile flown
*   Discounted First and Business Fare tickets earn 2 EQMs per mile flown
*   Full Economy Fare tickets earn 1.5 EQMs per mile flown
*   Discounted Economy Fare tickets 1 EQM per mile flown

Tickets purchased for travel on flights marketed by other carriers may earn a different (sometimes lower) amount for the same fare or booking code.  Please see the other eligible airline's page on [aa.com](http://aa.com/) to view their EQM accrual rate.

To determine which fare you will be purchasing, simply ask your booking agent (if in person or on the phone). When booking on [aa.com](http://aa.com/), check the ‘Flight Summary’ screen or click the (+) sign to the right of the flight number.

**Tips for success**

*   Plan your qualifying flights to meet your goal within the 3-month time frame selected

*   Fly on an eligible carrier, including eligible codeshare flights marketed by an eligible carrier

*   Upgrading? Keep in mind that EQMs earned are based on the class-of-service purchased
